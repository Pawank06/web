          Hi there! I&apos;m Pawan, and I love making things as a full-stack developer. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing and sharing, so I&apos;m always posting my progress and what I learn on social media.

        <p className=''>
          Right now, I&apos;m really into Solana and Web3, which are all about cool new ways of using the internet. I&apos;m learning all about them, and I&apos;ll be writing about my adventures on my blog.
        

        <br />

        Come along with me on this journey of discovery! We&apos;ll figure out Solana, explore Web3, and maybe even build some cool stuff together. Let&apos;s learn and grow together in the world of tech, step by step.
